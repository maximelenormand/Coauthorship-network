Building coauthorship networks with R
===================================================================================

This repository contains two scripts written in R for the creation and visualization of coauthorship networks. It focuses on an egonetwork centered around one scholar (me in the example). The nodes of the network are my coauthors (people with whom I published at least one paper) and the link between two coauthors is proportional to the number of papers they cosigned (if any). **ExtractNetwork** scraps data from Google Scholar using the R package **scholar** to build the network and **DrawNetwork** relies on the package **networkD3** to visualize it.
